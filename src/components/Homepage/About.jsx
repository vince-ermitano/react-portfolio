                        There are a variety of things I enjoy doing in my free
                        time outside of programming. I love listening to music
                        (this is an exception to 'outside of programming'). I
                        primarily listen to hip-hop/rap, r&b, pop, and
                        electronic (lo-fi when I'm in the coding zone). My
                        current favorite artists currently are Travis Scott, New
                        Jeans, and Future. Take a look at my{" "}
                        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/prince_vince3?si=c726d790cba64598" target="_blank">Spotify profile</a> to get an in-depth sense
                        of the music I like.

                    <p>
                        I also engage a little bit in photography due to getting
                        inspired from friends who actively pursue a career in
                        the field, the prominence of social media, as well as
                        the aesthetic of the location I lived at the time of
                        discovery. I'm usually inconsistent with my activeness
                        on the hobby, but when I am taking photos, it's
                        therapeutic and mentally stimulating at the same time
                        which sort of causes me to go on these periods where my
                        life only consists thinking about and taking photos. I,
                        typically, find myself taking street photos and
                        portraits. Photography is a great way for me to capture
                        memories, relive those moments, and share it with
                        everyone. You can check out some of my photos if you're
                        interested on my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/princevince.jp/" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.

                        Growing up as a kid with a decently sized sports
                        experience, I'm always doing something active.
                        Currently, I've been keeping in shape by going to the
                        gym (lifting weights) religiously. I'm not a gym-rat by
                        any means, but it's personally fulfilling to see myself
                        progress in terms of strength and physique. Also, as of
                        recently, I found myself playing golf, a completely new
                        sport to me. I started around October of 2023, and I
                        definitely have a tremendous amount of room to improve,
                        but the goal is to break 90 by the end of the year!

                        optimal performance, and security in all facets of
