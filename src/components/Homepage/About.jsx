                    There are a variety of things I enjoy doing in my free time
                    outside of programming. I love listening to{" "}
                    <a href="/">music</a>(I said 'outside of programming', but
                    this is an exception). I primarily listen to hip-hop/rap,
                    r&b, pop, and electronic (lo-fi when I'm in the coding
                    zone). My current artists currently are Travis Scott, New
                    Jeans, and Future. Take a look at my Spotify profile to get
                    an in-depth sense of the music I like.
                    <br />I also engage a little bit in{" "}
                    <a href="/">photography</a> due to getting inspired from
                    friends who actively pursue a career in the field, the
                    prominence of social media, as well as the aesthetic of the
                    location I lived at the time of discovery. I'm usually
                    inconsistent with my activeness on the hobby, but when I am
                    taking photos, it's therapeutic and mentally stimulating at
                    the same time which sort of causes me to go on these periods
                    where my life only consists thinking about and taking
                    photos. I, typically, find myself taking street photos and
                    portraits. Photography is a great way for me to capture
                    memories, relive those moments, and share it with everyone.
                    You can check out some of my photos if you're interested on
                    my <a href="/">Instagram</a>.

                    Growing up as a kid with a decently sized sports experience,
                    I'm always doing something active. Currently, I've been
                    keeping in shape by going to the gym (lifting weights)
                    religiously. I'm not a gym-rat by any means, but it's
                    personally fulfilling to see myself progress in terms of
                    strength and physique. Also, as of recently, I found myself
                    playing golf, a completely new sport to me. I started around
                    October of 2023, and I definitely have a tremendous amount
                    of room to improve, but the goal is to break 90 by the end
                    of the year!
